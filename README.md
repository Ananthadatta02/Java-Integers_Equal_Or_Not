# Java-Integers_Equal_Or_Not
This Java program takes two integers as input from the user and checks if they are equal. If the numbers are equal, it prints their product; otherwise, it prints the result of dividing the first number by the second. It uses the Scanner class for input and basic conditional logic for comparison.
